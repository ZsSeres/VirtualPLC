# VirtualPLC
A virtual PLC-like processor, which reads and processes the lines of a .txt file using it's own insctruction set.

It was one of my school project.

The following functions were implemented in the softvar:
-usage of integer and bool variables
-own instruction set: aritmetic, logical instructions
-Label management:conditional and unconditional jump instruction.
-Template for periphery management: gpio and virtual on delay timer.

The program was developed as a desktop consol App, however the main goal is to port it to ambient systems. (ESP8266)
